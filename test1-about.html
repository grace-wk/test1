				<h3>World Heritage</h3><br><br>
				<p>World Heritage Sites are landmarks or areas protected under a UNESCO treaty for their 
					cultural, historical, or natural significance. These sites, chosen by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 
					must be unique, significant, and legally protected. They include structures, cities, natural landscapes,
						 and mixed cultural-natural sites.

					As of July 2024, there are 1,223 sites across 168 countries, with Italy having the most (60),
					 followed by China (59) and Germany (54). The program, established by the 1972 UNESCO Convention,
					 aims to conserve these sites for future generations, 
					protecting them from threats such as neglect or unauthorized access.

				<h3>History origin</h3><br><br>
				<p>In response to Egypt's construction of the Aswan High Dam in 1954, which threatened to submerge significant cultural sites in the Nile valley,
					 UNESCO launched the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia in 1960. 
					This effort involved excavating and documenting numerous sites, recovering artifacts, 
					and relocating key temples, including Abu Simbel and Philae, to safer locations.

				<h3>Convention and background</h3><br><br>
				
			

				
				<p>The World Heritage Convention, guiding the work of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee,
					 was developed between 1965 and 1972. The idea, initiated by the United States,
					 aimed to safeguard significant cultural and natural sites globally. In 1965, 
					a White House conference proposed a "World Heritage Trust" to preserve these sites for humanity. 
						The International Union for Conservation of Nature contributed similar proposals,
					 leading to a finalized draft presented at the 1972 Stockholm UN Conference on the Human Environment.
